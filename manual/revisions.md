Roadmap
--------
  - finalizing v14.03

Revisions
---------

### v14.03-rc2
  - BOM corrections
     - HFS5-2040-55-TPW instead of HFS5-2040-55-LTP
     - one HFS5-2040-1620 was missing

### v14.03-rc1
The main change here is a new lens/nozzle assembly based on a 
sliding design. It's easier to adjust, can handle lenses down to
25mm focal length and has 40mm range. The other changes are 
non-functional but simplify the build process and make aligning
much easier. Along with this we also switched to standard ball 
bearings on M5 screws for all the cart rollers.

  - frame-bottom
    - made cable carrier base extrusion symmetric, added one left
      (allows for second cable carrier to run cameras, etc. to head)
    - outer separation panels part of Mount Pack, custom-cut
    - custom-cut cable/air tube passage holes in outer right separation
      panel. Passage holes allow pre-assembled cables to run through.
      Cover part to close extra space.
  - frame-top
    - four separation panels analog to frame-bottom. Outer panels
      are custom-cut and part of Panel Pack.
  - x-cart (build simplifications)
    - aluminum plates mount now to the end of the extrusions
      to eliminate alignment steps
    - rollers are now standard 5x14x5 ball bearings on M5 screws
    - adjustment ball bearing shaft screws are now supposed to touch 
      t-slot base and reverse nut is not necessary anymore
    - additional mount plate for cable carrier
    - washers under limit sensors
  - y-cart (build simplifications)
    - rollers are now standard 5x14x5 ball bearings on M5 screws

      t-slot base and reverse nut is not necessary anymore
    - washers under limit sensors
  - optics-laser

      - angle mount extrusion shortened to align with mirror mount
      - vertical mount extrusion extended to align with angled extrusion

    - nozzle lens assembly (improved focusing mechanism)
      - 2" lens tube held by Thorlabs CP12 part
      - nozzle friction-fit into 2" lens tube
      - MechParts mount plate modified to hold a sliding lens tube
  - electronics
    - e-stop moved to top panel
  - frame-panels
    - door front panel minimal overlap to reduce chopping danger
  - reorganized subsystems
    - frame-outer split up into frame-bottom and frame-top
    - frame-panels split up into frame-panels and door-panels
    - optimized build order of subsystems
    - columns of frame-table moved to frame-bottom
    - moved limit switch magnets to x-cart, y-cart
    - moved belt attachment screws to x-cart, y-cart

### v14.01b
- magnetic limit switches moved slightly
 - mount holes for y1, y2 moved 2mm closer towards y-cart (now 14mm from edge)
- lock screws for top bearing in x-drive gear moved to overlap bearing 0.5mm more
- lens tube hole on x-cart reduced in diameter slightly (had 1mm of play)
- screws in outer idlers of y-drive flipped
- CAD model cleaned up
- 1" SM1 lens tube now part of Lasersaur Nozzle (BOM shuffled around a bit)

### v14.01

- improved drive system for higher precision and easier maintenance
- magnetic limit switches for easier cleaning

For details see [revision v14.01 plans](rev14.01.md).

### v13.06
- BeagleBone Black in BOM, preconfigured option
- entry panel now from 3mm tinted acrylic, sealed with rubber inserts
- acrylic mount panels now available in Nortd Labs store for convenience
  - this includes entry panel, DriveBoard bottom hull, and top hull 
- Minor DriveBoard adaptation for BeagleBone Black compatibility
  - moved avr reset control from GPIO2_7 to GPIO2_9 because BBB does not boot otherwise

### v13.04 - BOM
- minor, moved a few components between subsystems
- added power entry module filtered, Mouser 5110.1033.1 (for good measure)
- magnetic limit switch mount screws (optional)

### v13.04 - Driveboard Image
- New Linux image for the Driveboard, see [BeagleBone Setup](beaglebone_setup.md)

### v13.02 - BOM update
- switched back to higher-amp motors (low-amp motors were a bit noisy)
  - Nanotec ST5918M3008-B (instead of ST5918M1008-B)
  - LinE WO-5718M-02ED (instead of WO-5718M-04ED) and WO-4118S-01F (instead of WO-4118S-04E)
- custom nozzle added
  - removed 4 Thorlabs items: SM1V05, SM1V10, SM1CP2M, SPW602
  - added: lock ring, Thorlabs SM1NT
- optics pack added: lens, 3x mirrors
- moved beam axis 1mm to left, optimize for 3mm (thickness) mirrors
  - mirror1 2mm to left, laser orifice 2mm to left
  - optics tube 1mm to right
- removed optics cleaning system from bom
  - Reason is that compressed air typically contains oils which
    causes more problems than is solves.
- added optics cleaning wipes and swabs (to be used with acetone)
- capacitors added to bom for v13.03 DriveBoard update

### v12.08
This revision introduces a new improved gantry, a simplified frame, and many small optimizations. It was made possible through generous support by Hyperwerk.ch and Studio for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University. For details on changes see the CAD models and [BOM](/lasersaur/manual/bom). 

  - simplified frame
